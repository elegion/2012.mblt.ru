		International Mobile Conference #MBLT12 took place on March 2012, 12 in Moscow at the Digital October center. The organizers of the conference, where the key players of the mobile technology arena discussed the perspectives and opportunities of mobile development, were the e-Legion and dots&#39;n&#39;spaces companies.</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
	<div>
		7 panels were presented in the main hall: Mobile Manufacturers, Mobile Marketing, Internet of Things, Game Development, Mobile Browsers, Mobile Development and Mobile Advertising as well as two presentations: &laquo;Mobile internet in Russia&raquo; by Tarasov Mobile&rsquo;s CEO Dmitry Tarasov and &laquo;Apps That Make Sense&raquo; by Opera&#39;s Marketing Coordinator Ilya Shpankov. The panels about production and promotion of apps, as well as Yandex Mobile Camp, in which the Yandex developers were sharing their experience in programming for mobile platforms, were on the special focus.</div>
	<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		The main organizer of the conference, e-Legion&rsquo;s CEO Alex Zverev, was also moderating the conference.</p>
	<p>

	<p>
		The section &ldquo;Mobile Manufacturers&rsquo;&rsquo;s moderator Olga Steidl, dots&#39;n&#39;spaces Owner and one of the conference&rsquo;s co-organizers, has opened it. After presenting the speakers, among whom were Ola Lars&eacute;n and Andrey Kiselev (BlackBerry) and Dmitry Gorilovsky (Yota), the discussion went on about the future of mobile devices.</p>

		Daria Batukhtina was the section moderator. She is a skilled expert in communications and PR in Europe and Russia.

	<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		Speaking about the promotion problems and their difference for Russia and Europe, Daria Batukhtina mentioned: &ldquo;The market is totally different. At the moment, there are just three million of Android devices and 1,5 million of iPhones in Russia. Business targets are rarely taken into account while speaking of mobile communications&rdquo;.</p>
	<p>
		&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		Although, judging from her following words, the situation is changing. The potential of Russian mobile audience is very high: it is not overfed by mobile advertisement so much, it reacts to creative ideas and enthusiastically uses new opportunities of mobile marketing. Plus, the mentality of a Russian customer is pretty close to a European one &ndash; he is ready to make purchases with the help of a mobile device if there&rsquo;s a comfortable way to do it.</p>
